# Inner dynamic motions

> What if we're able to distill and identify each person's characteristic movements and amplify them to enhance their expressive potential?

## Intro : inspiration
Dance and movement have always been some of my favorite forms of expression. The freedom it provides, the connection with music and opportunity of simply flowing capture my body and it is not difficult to find myself completely lost in the moment. But not every moment is spent on a dancefloor -I don't even enjoy clubs that much-. I want to express myself through motion more. And I want it to be more powerful. I want my movements to fill the space, for them to be join me and help me communicate intensified feelings to a large audience.

Moreover, my studies in feminism and my experience in such an organization have made me reflect on diverse dimensions of human nature: how we structure society, how we relate to each other, the meanings we assign to our actions and movements. Many of the signifiers carry enormous weights, certain forms of expression are frowned upon when they come from certain bodies. Discrimination is highly based on sight: skin color, facial features, assumed gender identity. I want to get rid of that. I want to hide it and diminish it. For it not to matter at all. For it to be disregarded as noise until someone remembers bodies actually exist.

I want to explore movement's potential, finding connections with someone's identity to be able to amplify it in a way that makes sense and enhances it's expressiveness.


## Chroreography
My first approach was to explore what has been done in choreography mixed with technology. [Merce Cunningham](https://www.mercecunningham.org/) used the I-Ching to compose his dances, as a first approach to [algorithmic choreography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_Choreography).  [Kate Sicchio's](http://blog.sicchio.com) work [Hacking Choreography](http://blog.sicchio.com/works/hacking-choreography/) [& 2.0](http://blog.sicchio.com/works/hacking-choreography-2-0/) explore coding and choreography, mixing and crossing over the domain of both. She went even further making [Hacking the Body](http://blog.sicchio.com/works/hacking-the-body/), introducing the body as a way of gaining feedback for these presentations.

On the other hand, it is also interesting to see different attempts to annotate and describe choreography on paper (or a computer). [Labanotation](http://www.dancenotation.org/lnbasics/frame0.html) is one of the first attempts to describe movement literally. The [Choreographic Language Agent](https://waynemcgregor.com/research/choreographic-language-agent) is a research from Wayne McGregor with [Marc Downie](http://openendedgroup.com/) and [Nick Rothwell](http://www.cassiel.com/tag/random-dance/) which ended in *Becoming*, an "interactive digital object to support dance making in the studio". Their shapes and how they describe movement is useful to know how to do the opposite, creating visuals from movement. In [Synchronous Objects](https://synchronousobjects.osu.edu/content.html), [William Forsythe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQdZBOVYLdI) takes a data visualization approach of multiple performers, creating complex and interconnected systems and objects.

Finally, other interesting representations are the abstractions of the bodies and movements, with some fantastic amplifications of the motion. The [Ballet Rotoscope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzJk6ww3LD0) and the [Performance and movement analytic in Zero Gravity](https://vimeo.com/199443992) abstract the body into a set of points, which connections make them disappear, letting us observe a different dimension of the movement alone. [Memo Atken and Davide Quayola's Forms](https://vimeo.com/37967381), [Denis Poulin and Martine Ã‰poque's CODA](https://www.nfb.ca/film/coda_en/) and [Tobias Gremmler's Kung Fu Motion Visualization](https://vimeo.com/163153865) show exquisite abstractions of motion, relying on varied textures, colors and even physical properties of the particles.


## Inspiration and other work
[Treachery of Sanctuary, by Chris Milk](http://milk.co/treachery) is a work that inspired the final form of my thesis project. It captures and transforms the bodies of the audience, creating awe inspiring and playful visualizations. A seemingly simple design and interaction, but with a powerful impact.

Furthermore, the triptych display gives me the idea to enhance the experience by playing with the audience's expectations and even prejudices. By creating a parallel layer of the middle segment and hiding the participants, the audience will only see the result of the interaction without gazing at the subject. They will try to form a mental image of that subject which will only be revealed when that subject comes out of that section.
