# Movement, expression and our souls

Everyday, I wake up, take a shower and see myself in the mirror. I style my hair, put on makeup and try different clothes. I know my image. My friends and colleagues know it too. But even if I change clothes, haircut or style, they can still recognize me on the street from afar. This is because there are more visual cues linked to our identity. How we walk, the way we move our hands or even our arms when we talk, it is all part of our personality. This is the premise of Nicol치s Escarpentier's latest work: *Soul projection*, that movement is an inherent part of our identity and our particular gestures can be amplified to enhance our means of expression.

Nicol치s, a non-binary Chilean new media artist that strives to "augment and create non-conventional forms of expression", has spent a long time researching identity and expression both as art and activism practices. From reflecting on society's role in oppression (in Collected Ego, Coalition and Everyday Windows) to questioning the validity of our own bodies (Me as myself), they chose to pursuit a project to express their own feelings, confusion and discoveries. Escarpentier's project was created by mixing machine learning algorithms with over-the-top audiovisual content, granting the audience a playful and magical experience.

> What if we're able to distill and identify each person's characteristic movements and amplify them? - Soul projection's driving question

The exhibition started with a performance by the author, where they showcased the full capabilities and range of their work. It was a mix of performance art with modern dance, on top of multilayered projections and multiple transformations of their outfit. A magical experience that was as impressive as emotional. Each sentiment was coordinated with lights, visuals, words and sounds, dispelling any doubt as to what was being said, without any words being uttered.

Then, it was the turn of the audience to try the 10 meter interactive wall. As more and more people took turns on the projection space, my interest transformed into fascination. After standing in front of the space, it was like their bodies were fully transferred or interpreted on the wall. It understood them. As soon as they started moving, figures started appearing. First small, cautious. Then a rush of energy and curiosity invades your body. You want to trick it, to expose the seams of this proposed reality and see the circuits and code of the technology behind. But the outbursts are perfectly matched. The energy that irradiates and where it comes from is a bit uncanny but faithful. Almost as if your soul was actually connected to the machine and can show you all its colors.

Hopefully, Nicol치s' work will be a starting point of a transformative career. Their subjects of study all have to deal with contemporary and difficult subjects, but if they can create experiences such as this one, where the creation of emotion is at it's core, the world will surely continue moving towards a more accepting place.



Finally, one of the
the purity of the movement/removal of labels

Where in the first stage you can see your body reflected on the wall, the last stage doesn't have bodies just to give the movement the spotlight.
It doesn't possess a body, but it is recognizable as yourself. It's non-gendered. It's pure movement and essence. As if it's reading your aura it paints different colours on you, but I wouldn't dare to judge anyone based on it. It's simply who they are. Sorry, or how Nicol치s' creation paints them. It is that believable.
