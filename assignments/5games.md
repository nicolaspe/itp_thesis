# 5 games

My keywords for this exercise were **identity / expression**. A lot of useful concepts came up, and the games I chose to carry out were:

1. make people select colors and shapes and make a portrait
2. pose on the dancefloor
3. go to stores, get clothes and dress up! (on the changing room)
4. create fake IDs
5. act as a frontperson (study of character)



## Color portraits
I started experimenting with colors and textures this week, so I had the idea of reusing a Processing sketch and do some portraits on the floor. For them to be more personal, I asked each person for 3 colors they liked and adjusted the threshold and grain levels once they were in front of the camera.

## Killin' it on the dancefloor!
Well, so I didn't go dancing this week, so I went to the newly-renovated microstudio and did some "[voguing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(dance))" (credit to Azalea for this idea). (I tried doing my best, but it's hella hard!)




## Dressing up!
The idea of this game was to pick a bunch of clothes, go to dressing rooms and create characters according to the clothes. Looking back, I could've performed more, with some more planning or exaggerating more each one. Still, it was **really** fun.

## Fake IDs
This ended up taking too long and was boring


## Be a frontperson
My last game was imitating some frontpeople (as in, the lead singer and person on the front in a band). This was fun, as I had to quickly assess parts of their character to do a 10 second clip. Clearly, to do it better I'd need a lot of hair done and a much bigger closet.

*(feeling self-conscious right now, so I won't upload these... might do it later - or not)*
